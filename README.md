# Snake Project

## Project Description
This is a simple version of the classic snake game that has been implemented using java, javafx and swing. The game has 
been analysed and optimised to make it maintainable including testing, refactoring classes and file structure, adding 
Maven, etc.

## How to Play
Press play in start screen and the game will then start running. To move the snake you use the arrow keys or wasd. 
The goal of the game is to eat as many fruits that appear as possible without hitting the borders or crashing into your 
own body. Each fruit is worth 100 points when eaten. Every time you eat a fruit the snakes body increases in size making
it more difficult to survive. Crashing into the walls or yourself will end the game. Good Luck, Have Fun!
